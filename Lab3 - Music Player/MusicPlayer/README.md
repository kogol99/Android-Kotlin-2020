# Music Player

 An application that allows you to play music tracks on your phone.

 For the purposes of classes and testing, the details of the songs were defined directly in the code.
 The current structure allows you to connect the database with information such as: song, title, author and cover.

 If there is no song information, the default cover art is displayed along with the file name.
